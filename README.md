# AI-Stage

Making local AI accessible to everyone

AI-Stage is an ambitious project aimed at democratizing access to AI technology by providing a user-friendly platform for running AI models locally. Our vision is to create a comprehensive solution that combines local GPT models, speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and intuitive interfaces - all while keeping your data private and secure on your own machine.

🎯 Vision & Goals
Primary Objectives
- **Accessibility:** Make AI technology approachable for users of all technical levels
- **Privacy:** Keep your conversations and data completely local and private
- **Customization:** Provide specialized AI models for different use cases
- Entertainment & Content Creation: Enable streamers, content creators, and entertainers to integrate AI into their creative workflows
- **Education:** Offer comprehensive guides and explanations about AI technology

Target Features (Roadmap)

- 🤖 Multiple local GPT model support (basic and specialized)
- 🎙️ Speech-to-Text integration for voice interactions
- 🔊 Text-to-Speech for natural conversations
- 💬 Advanced chat interfaces with conversation history
- ✨ Prompt engineering tools and templates
- 🎬 Content creator tools and streaming integrations
- 🎮 Interactive AI characters and personalities
- 📚 Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- 🛠️ Step-by-step setup guides for non-technical users
- 💬 Community support and contact system
